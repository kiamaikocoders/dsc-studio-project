![corr](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/972f7a00-ced6-43c8-8be3-96c9503de3be)
- A strong positive correlation exists between the production budget and domestic and worldwide gross revenues, indicating that higher budgets tend to result in higher earnings. Additionally, the runtime shows a moderate positive correlation with worldwide gross, suggesting that longer movies may achieve greater global revenue, though this relationship is weaker for domestic gross. Overall, these insights suggest that investing in higher production budgets and potentially longer runtimes could be associated with better financial performance, providing valuable guidance for future movie production strategies.

winter holiday seasons to maximize box office returns.

range and aim for movie runtimes between 90 to 120 minutes. This strategy balances
cost and potential revenue, enhancing profitability.

## Next Steps

markets.
